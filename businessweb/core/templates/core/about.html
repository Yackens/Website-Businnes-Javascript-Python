              </h2>
              <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the beautiful streets of Madrid's historic Plaza Mayor. It was here where L'AUTENTICO CAFFÃˆ D'ITALIA opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home.</p>
              <p>Our name was inspired by the classic Italian's coffee culture evoking the classic tradition of the early coffee traders. </p>
